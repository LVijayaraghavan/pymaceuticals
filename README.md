In this pymaceutial analysis ,  250 mice were treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days. Their physiological responses were then monitored over the course of that time. The objective is to analyze the data to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare.

Observations from the Data Analysis

1. Effect on Tumor volume : The Drug Capomulin has more effect in Shrinking the Tumor volume. All other Drugs compared relatively the same and did not cause any reduction in tumor volume
2. Effect On Metastatic spread: The Metastatic spread during treatment was the lowest in Capomulin , followed by Infubinol , followed by Ketapril and Placebo. This shows that Capomulin was an effective drug both in tumor size reduction and not much metatatic spread
3. Effect on Survival rate : Capomulin Survival rate was significantly higher . 84%  survival rate compared to other drugs and placebo.
